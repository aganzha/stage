BUG: expand TODO, then expand text_view.rs and main.rs is DISAPEARED! must be related to hunk lines!
- store number in each line. store hunk line in each hunk
- when insert line in text buffer store line number of inserted line in line itself!
  store map of lines in hunks and map of hunks in file!
- so, when user clicks line , it need to detect everything: line, hunk and file by the number when clicked line in text buffer

-- HUGHLIGHT for pgup/pgdown doesn not work
- put label with current repo name (relative to path the app is started)
- adwaita ToolbarView
- popup widnwow from current line (commit)
- put symbolic expand tag/href to expand regions with mouse
- open another repo in file choose dialog
- open repo under other user causeing error! handle it!
- .gitignore does not counted in gitlib2 !!!! flags : Status(IGNORED)
- when put mouse in the end of line it does not highlighted

- in parallel thread, go to the source file, while read hunks and put whole file in tree sitter,
make a syntax, highlight it and put into the diff. while insert line into the buffer, paint it with tags
by the tree sitter structure
- after push add text link to mr in gitlab and github!
