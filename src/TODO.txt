- DONE - the problem with hunk is - it remains active by self.hidden lines!
      hunk         Hunk A         Hunk
           line       line A         line A
           line       lime A         line A
      Active by child
      2 cases.
        - we either make then inactive if they are collapsed OR
        - check dymamically if they are collapsed?
    
- DONE - why it is called 12 times????? looks like those are another hunks! they are just collapsed. view.line_no is 0
- BUG - hit right. expand + collapse. hit right - expand. IT IS JUST STARTED WITH LINE 4
- BUG - why so many times collapsed are called for 0 0

- DONE - first whole file is yellow

- BUG - other COLLAPSED hunks got highlighted while traverse lines in other hunk. must be related to hidden lines

- BUG when put mouse in the end of line it does not highlighted
- put symbolic expand tag/href to expand regions with mouse

-- HUGHLIGHT for pgup/pgdown doesn not work
- put label with current repo name (relative to path the app is started)
- try to replace &mut dyn RecursiveViewContainer with type alias

- adwaita ToolbarView
- popup widnwow from current line (commit)

- open another repo in file choose dialog
- open repo under other user causeing error! handle it!

- .gitignore does not counted in gitlib2 !!!! flags : Status(IGNORED)


- in parallel thread, go to the source file, while read hunks and put whole file in tree sitter,
make a syntax, highlight it and put into the diff. while insert line into the buffer, paint it with tags
by the tree sitter structure
- after push add text link to mr in gitlab and github!
