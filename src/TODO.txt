STAGING LINE INSIDE HUNK (STAGING HUNK MUST BE THE SAME)
1. after staging 1 hunk, other hunk headers changed!
   so all hunks must be rerenderred!. but how to i know them?
   headers are changed??? so what? it need just to render file stupid!
   The file will remain expanded and on the same line.
   All other hunkns then what???
   old_hunks: line_no: 5, a c, line_no: 10, na nc.
   is it need to kill everything inside file (as it being collapsed)????
   probably yes. because there are no way to match old views - hunk headers,
   are changed. even hunk is the same.

   lets try to kill everuthing inside file.

   !!!!!!!!!!!!for future and clarity - next hunk become active and current in magit, when prev hunk staged
   !!!!!!!!!!!!for future and clarity - in magit when staging hunk staged FILES are not expanded.
   (hunks are expanded by default)
   

- whats get applied???
- where is this diff stored???


- refactor cursor to every view, by selecting actual view.
do not call render on everything

- collapse when press tab on line? YES, please


- open with no diff in files. works weird

- BUG when put mouse in the end of line it does not highlighted
- put symbolic expand tag/href to expand regions with mouse

-- HUGHLIGHT for pgup/pgdown doesn not work
- put label with current repo name (relative to path the app is started)
- try to replace &mut dyn RecursiveViewContainer with type alias

- adwaita ToolbarView
- popup widnwow from current line (commit)

- open another repo in file choose dialog
- open repo under other user causeing error! handle it!

- .gitignore does not counted in gitlib2 !!!! flags : Status(IGNORED)


op


- in parallel thread, go to the source file, while read hunks and put whole file in tree sitter,
make a syntax, highlight it and put into the diff. while insert line into the buffer, paint it with tags
by the tree sitter structure
- after push add text link to mr in gitlab and github!
