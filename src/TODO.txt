BUG: kill in untracked stages it + what if it is a directory???
BUG: unstaging 1 untracked unstage all untracked (perhaps in libgit)
BUG: search item in branches. checkout with active search - core dump.
     because newly checkout item is not in list???
     
so, about search - the head is does not matter. what matter is selected position.
it need to update list in such a way, that selected position is always visible
PERFORMANCE: delete ~/docs/client/WHDDemo and open app :)
Perhaps it need to put path to status. and window to context!!!!

BUG: state Revert was cleared, but refresh btn does not reflect that
BUG: does not completed remote branch for push
BUG: do not know how to reproduse: after creating branch staging was not working cause ApplyFilter was empty!
BUG: during merge do not create final commit. all changes will be in staged and state will be merge.
     reset --hard from console and then refresh - there is a garbage string on the place of State
     
BUG: checkout remote branch. then checkout remote branch again!
