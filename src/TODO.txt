THOUGHT: why cherry-pick always create commit. is it required?
BUG: when copy branch in very firts line and upstream event is arrived the cursor moved to line 2. it need to rerstore cursor position
BUG: copy folder to repo. reset hard. then copy subfolder in same path to repo - no monitor evenmt
BUG: updating branches (refresh button) - it is not analogue of git remote update. it does not fetch branches from local repo (cloned clocally)
  
so, after_cursor could be eliminated in the favour of under_cursor.
just introduce first_active_line and second_active_line to store range of lines!
  
BUG: CRITICAL: when intriduce changes in line whicj is in hunk header kill does not work! stash: broken_kill
     how to fix: it need to steps comparing hunk header: fully, and then search for same line in other hunk!

perhaps because its coming last and erasing content on top!

so, about search - the head is does not matter. what matter is selected position.
it need to update list in such a way, that selected position is always visible
